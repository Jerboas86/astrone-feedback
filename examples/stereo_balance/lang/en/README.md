## Description

A pure tone is produced through a dichotic system. You can control:

- The sound level with the `Volume` slider
- The Frequency of the pure tone with the `FrÃ©quence` slider (meaning Frequency)
- The stereo balance with the `Gauche-Droite` slider (meaning Left-Right)

The stereo balance is reached when the pure tone is equally received in both ears. The balance is obtained by adjustement of the `Gauche-Droite` slider.
