## Description

A narrow-band noise is produced. You can control:

- The sound level of the narrow-band noise with the `Volume` slider.
- The central frequency of the narrow-band noise with the `FrÃ©quence` slider (meaning frequency).
- The width of noise band with the `Largeur de bande` slider (meaning band width)

The narrow band noise needs to be produced at a confortable level. The frequency needs to be adjusted to the reference signal.
The widening of the noise pass band increase the spectral richness.
